regular.js: Regular Expression abstract syntax for Regular Javascript pogrammers
================================================================================

Currently a WIP, though you /can/ take some derivatives, check nullability, and stream the
language. Bugs included.

This library is emphatically /not/ for matching regular expressions, though it can be used
for that, but for manipulating for them e.g. visual demonstrations.

Requirements:

 * Underscore.js
 * stream.js

Requirements for the demo:

 * jquery
 * jsPlumb
